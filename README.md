Wheel is a library for the [D programming language](https://www.dlang.org) which provides
a high-level interface to the [Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)](https://www.libsdl.org) library.

It is built upon the [BindBC SDL binding](https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictSDL2) and some
imports are required from BindBC to set SDL up and use some features.
